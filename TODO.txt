 - To separate between the actual game and editor, create the ability to add command line arguments to differentiate between the two

 - At some point it might be nice to try and figure out how to import raymarching for ultimate pretty

 - So what if we had two windows

How does this correlate to the idea you had that you wanted to communicate?
 

 - SetWindowPosition() is a function you can use to set the window position on the monitor
 - For the interaction system you can use function pointers inside of structs and do stuff that way



Sadly, raylib does not support multiple windows in one instance
What you can do instead is create multiple executables and then create some sort of file to transfer data over from one executable to the other

system("file.exe") will run the executable, it's included in <stdlib.h>




What is our best course of action here:





Design a rule for gameb puzzle 


Figure out how to $(SolutionDir) things to make it possible for other machines to get the imported info for things like models and textures

It would also probably be nice if you made the player a little taller

Might consider separating some of the stuff in the controller, it's getting quite long

At some point, it might be best if you turn some of the arrays of elements into linked lists, this way we are able to destroy things if need be like doors when they extend all the way


Create ability for puzzles to power on other puzzles

Make it more obvious when you complete a puzzle/enter into a puzzle 

To create power puzzle on ability:
    - We need to pass in the assoicated powered off puzzle to the puzzle that is going to power it on through the gameplay elements struct (if we can)
    - Probably create some sort of function pointer that will call the power on ability 
    - We can reuse the SwitchTextureOnPuzzleState function


You might be able to assign buttons the same textures without loading new ones everytime you create a new button 
    - This is gonna require some thinking on how to restructure the way you are currently destructing textures and models
