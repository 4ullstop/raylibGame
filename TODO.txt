 - To separate between the actual game and editor, create the ability to add command line arguments to differentiate between the two

 - At some point it might be nice to try and figure out how to import raymarching for ultimate pretty

 - So what if we had two windows

How does this correlate to the idea you had that you wanted to communicate?
 

 - SetWindowPosition() is a function you can use to set the window position on the monitor
 - For the interaction system you can use function pointers inside of structs and do stuff that way



Sadly, raylib does not support multiple windows in one instance
What you can do instead is create multiple executables and then create some sort of file to transfer data over from one executable to the other

system("file.exe") will run the executable, it's included in <stdlib.h>




What is our best course of action here:





Design a rule for gameb puzzle 


Figure out how to $(SolutionDir) things to make it possible for other machines to get the imported info for things like models and textures

It would also probably be nice if you made the player a little taller

Might consider separating some of the stuff in the controller, it's getting quite long



Make it more obvious when you complete a puzzle/enter into a puzzle 


The Cursor is beginning to become a little hard to discerne from the rest of the puzzle might want to end up changing the color of it


At some point, you need to start using Freedom units

printf("The address of x is: %p\n", (void *)ptr);

Create ordered solutions
    - Create glaringly obvious error when player inputs buttons incorrectly





Kind of horrifically, things are not checked very well which leads to crashing when you are creating puzzles, this is probably a thing that should be fixed\

If your cursor gets stuck, meaning there is no where for it to exit one button away, reset the puzzle

Quality of life features to be added or reworked:
    - Rework the button solution sizes (some of them are too similiar to others making it difficult to discerne which is which)



- BIG TO SMALL

Remake intro to moving around since the two actions are split in two different puzzles 
Make it so you are taking the player's facing direction into affect when the player interacts
Errors only flash after first time inputting incorrect solution

START ON GAME B

I hate myself for not getting any work done these past few days you need to start locking in
 - That's okay because today will be a productive day

Game B stuff to do:
 - Models like walls and floors
 - A test puzzle
 - Think about the design of game b
